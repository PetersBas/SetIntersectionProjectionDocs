abstract="This paper develops a general framework for solving a variety of convex cone problems that frequently arise in signal processing, machine learning, statistics, and other fields. The approach works as follows: first, determine a conic formulation of the problem; second, determine its dual; third, apply smoothing; and fourth, solve using an optimal first-order method. A merit of this approach is its flexibility: for example, all compressed sensing problems can be solved via this approach. These include models with objective functionals such as the total-variation norm, ||Wx||1 where W is arbitrary, or a combination thereof. In addition, the paper introduces a number of technical contributions such as a novel continuation scheme and a novel approach for controlling the step size, and applies results showing that the smooth and unsmoothed problems are sometimes formally equivalent. Combined with our framework, these lead to novel, stable and computationally efficient algorithms. For instance, our general implementation is competitive with state-of-the-art methods for solving intensively studied problems such as the LASSO. Further, numerical experiments show that one can solve the Dantzig selector problem, for which no efficient large-scale solvers exist, in a few hundred iterations. Finally, the paper is accompanied with a software release. This software is not a single, monolithic solver; rather, it is a suite of programs and routines designed to serve as building blocks for constructing complete algorithms.",

abstract="We propose a new first-order splitting algorithm for solving jointly the primal and dual formulations of large-scale convex minimization problems involving the sum of a smooth function with Lipschitzian gradient, a nonsmooth proximable function, and linear composite functions. This is a full splitting approach, in the sense that the gradient and the linear operators involved are applied explicitly without any inversion, while the nonsmooth functions are processed individually via their proximity operators. This work brings together and notably extends several classical splitting schemes, like the forward--backward and Douglas--Rachford methods, as well as the recent primal--dual method of Chambolle and Pock designed for problems with linear composite terms.",

title="The direct extension of ADMM for multi-block convex minimization problems is not necessarily convergent",
journal="Mathematical Programming",
year="2016",
volume="155",
number="1",
pages="57--79",
abstract="The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is now widely used in many fields, and its convergence was proved when two blocks of variables are alternatively updated. It is strongly desirable and practically valuable to extend the ADMM directly to the case of a multi-block convex minimization problem where its objective function is the sum of more than two separable convex functions. However, the convergence of this extension has been missing for a long time---neither an affirmative convergence proof nor an example showing its divergence is known in the literature. In this paper we give a negative answer to this long-standing open question: The direct extension of ADMM is not necessarily convergent. We present a sufficient condition to ensure the convergence of the direct extension of ADMM, and give an example to show its divergence.",

	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion can be formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. This non-convex problem can be extremely computationally expensive because it requires repeatedly solving large linear systems that correspond to discretized partial differential equations. Randomized subsampling techniques allow us to work with small subsets of (monochromatic) source experiments, reducing the computational cost. However, this subsampling weakens subsurface illumination and introduces subsampling related incoherent artifacts. These subsampling-related artifacts{\textendash}-in conjunction with local minima that are known to plague full-waveform inversion{\textendash}-motivate us to come up with a technique to "regularize" this problem. Following earlier work, we take advantage of the fact that curvelets represent subsurface models and perturbations parsimoniously. At first impulse promoting sparsity on the model directly seems the most natural way to proceed, but we will demonstrate that in certain cases it can be advantageous to promote sparsity on the Gauss-Newton updates instead. While constraining the one-norm of the descent directions does not change not change the underlying full-waveform inversion objective, the constrained model updates remain descent directions, remove subsampling-related artifacts and improve the overall inversion result. We empirically observe this phenomenon in situations where the different model updates occur at roughly the same locations in the curvelet domain. We further investigate and analyze this phenomenon, where nonlinear inversions benefit from sparsity-promoting constraints on the updates, by means of a set of carefully selected examples including phase retrieval and full-waveform inversion. In all cases, we observe a faster decay of the residual and model error as a function of the number of iterations.},

  abstract={This paper presents in a general form the most popular local minimization search solutions for geophysical inverse problems—the Tikhonov regularization solutions, the smoothest model solutions and the subspace solutions, from which the inter-relationships between these solutions are revealed. For the Tikhonov regularization solution, a variety of forms exist—the general iterative formula, the iterative linearized scheme, the Levenberg–Marquardt version, the conjugate gradient solver (CGS) and local-search quadratic approximation CGS. It is shown here that the first three solutions are equivalent and are just a specified form of the gradient solution. The local-search quadratic approximation CGS is shown to be a more general form from which these three solutions emerge. The smoothest model solution (Occam's inversion) is a subset of the Tikhonov regularization solutions, for which a practical algorithm generally comprises two parts: (1) determine the subset of the Tikhonov regularization solutions which satisfy the desired tolerance of data fit, (2) choose the solution which best fits the data in the subset. The solution procedure is actually an adaptive Tikhonov regularization solution. The subspace solution is mathematically no more than a dimension-decreased transform of model parameterization in the Tikhonov regularization solution or the smoothest model solution. The crucial step is to choose the basis vectors which span the whole model space in the parameterization transform. A simple form of the transform is developed which yields greater flexibility for geophysical inverse applications.}

abstract="The alternating direction method is one of the attractive approaches for solving linearly constrained separate monotone variational inequalities. Experience on applications has shown that the number of iterations depends significantly on the penalty parameter for the system of linear constraint equations. While the penalty parameter is a constant in the original method, in this paper we present a modified alternating direction method that adjusts the penalty parameter per iteration based on the iterate message. Preliminary numerical tests show that the self-adaptive adjustment technique is effective in practice.",

abstract ={Two automatic ways of estimating the regularization parameter in underdetermined, minimum-structure-type solutions to non-linear inverse problems are compared: the generalized cross-validation and L-curve criteria. Both criteria provide a means of estimating the regularization parameter when only the relative sizes of the measurement uncertainties in a set of observations are known. The criteria, which are established components of linear inverse theory, are applied to the linearized inverse problem at each iteration in a typical iterative, linearized solution to the non-linear problem. The particular inverse problem considered here is the simultaneous inversion of electromagnetic loop–loop data for 1-D models of both electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. The performance of each criteria is illustrated with inversions of a variety of synthetic and field data sets. In the great majority of examples tested, both criteria successfully determined suitable values of the regularization parameter, and hence credible models of the subsurface.},

abstract ={Subsurface velocities within the Earth often contain piecewise-constant structures with sharp interfaces. Acoustic- and elastic-waveform inversion (AEWI) usually produces smoothed inversion results of subsurface geophysical properties. We develop novel AEWI methods using a modified total-variation regularization scheme to preserve sharp interfaces in piecewise-constant structures and improve the accuracy of compressional- and shear wave velocity inversion. We use an alternating-minimization algorithm to solve the minimization problem of our new waveform inversion methods. We decouple the original optimization problem into two simple subproblems: a standard waveform inversion subproblem with the Tikhonov regularization and a standard L2–TV subproblem. We solve these two subproblems separately using the non-linear conjugate-gradient and split-Bregman iterative methods. The computational costs of our new waveform inversion methods using the modified total-variation regularization scheme are comparable to those of conventional waveform inversion approaches. Our numerical examples using synthetic seismic reflection data show that our new methods not only preserve sharp interfaces of subsurface structures, but also significantly improve the accuracy of compressional- and shear wave velocity inversion.},

  abstract={We present a nonlinear optimization method for large-scale 3D elastic full-waveform seismic inversion. The method combines outer Gauss–Newton nonlinear iterations with inner conjugate gradient linear iterations, globalized by an Armijo backtracking line search, solved on a sequence of finer grids and higher frequencies to remain in the vicinity of the global optimum, inexactly terminated to prevent oversolving, preconditioned by L-BFGS/Frankel, regularized by a total variation operator to capture sharp interfaces, finely discretized by finite elements in the Lamé parameter space to provide flexibility and avoid bias, implemented in matrix-free fashion with adjoint-based computation of reduced gradient and reduced Hessian-vector products, checkpointed to avoid full spacetime waveform storage, and partitioned spatially across processors to parallelize the solutions of the forward and adjoint wave equations and the evaluation of gradient-like information. Several numerical examples demonstrate the grid independence of linear and nonlinear iterations, the effectiveness of the preconditioner, the ability to solve inverse problems with up to 17 million inversion parameters on up to 2048 processors, the effectiveness of multiscale continuation in keeping iterates in the basin of attraction of the global minimum, and the ability to fit the observational data while reconstructing the model with reasonable resolution and capturing sharp interfaces.}

However, like most waveform based inversion methods, wavefield reconstruction inversion also requires good source wavelets. Without correct source wavelets, wavefields cannot be reconstructed correctly and the velocity model cannot be updated correctly neither. In this work, we propose a source estimation method for wavefield reconstruction inversion based on the variable projection method. In this method, we reconstruct wavefields and estimate source wavelets simultaneously by solving an extended least-squares problem, which contains source wavelets. This approach does not increase the computational cost compared to conventional wavefield reconstruction inversion. Numerical results illustrates with our source estimation method we are able to recover source wavelets and obtain inversion results that are comparable to results obtained with true source wavelets.},

abstract ={Multiparameter full waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging quantitative seismic imaging method for lithological characterization and reservoir monitoring. The difficulties in multiparameter FWI arise from the variable influence of the different parameter classes on the phase and amplitude of the data, and the trade-off between these. In this framework, choosing a suitable parametrization of the subsurface and designing the suitable FWI workflow are two key methodological issues in non-linear waveform inversion. We assess frequency-domain visco-acoustic FWI to reconstruct the compressive velocity (VP), the density (ρ) or the impedance (IP) and the quality factor (QP), from the hydrophone component, using a synthetic data set that is representative of the Valhall oil field in the North Sea. We first assess which of the (VP, ρ) and (VP, IP) parametrizations provides the most reliable FWI results when dealing with wide-aperture data. Contrary to widely accepted ideas, we show that the (VP, ρ) parametrization allows a better reconstruction of both the VP, ρ and IP parameters, first because it favours the broad-band reconstruction of the dominant VP parameter, and secondly because the trade-off effects between velocity and density at short-to-intermediate scattering angles can be removed by multiplication, to build an impedance model. This allows for the matching of the reflection amplitudes, while the broad-band velocity model accurately describes the kinematic attributes of both the diving waves and reflections. Then, we assess different inversion strategies to recover the quality factor QP, in addition to parameters VP and ρ. A difficulty related to attenuation estimation arises because, on the one hand the values of QP are on average one order of magnitude smaller than those of VP and ρ, and on the other hands model perturbations relative to the starting models can be much higher for QP than for VP and ρ during FWI. In this framework, we show that an empirical tuning of the FWI regularization, which is adapted to each parameter class, is a key issue to correctly account for the attenuation in the inversion. We promote a hierarchical approach where the dominant parameter VP is reconstructed first from the full data set (i.e. without any data preconditioning) to build a velocity model as kinematically accurate as possible before performing the joint update of the three parameter classes during a second step. This hierarchical imaging of compressive wave speed, density and attenuation is applied to a real wide-aperture ocean-bottom-cable data set from the Valhall oil field. Several geological features, such as accumulation of gas below barriers of claystone and soft quaternary sediment are interpreted in the FWI models of density and attenuation. The models of VP, ρ and QP that have been developed by visco-acoustic FWI of the hydrophone data can be used as initial models to perform visco-elastic FWI of the geophone data for the joint update of the compressive and shear wave speeds.},

This makes accurate estimation of multiple-parameters very difficult. To mitigate the problems, sequential strategies, regularization methods and scalings of gradients and quasi-Newton Hessians have been proposed. All of these require design, fine-tuning and adaptation to different waveform inversion problems. We propose to use a sparse approximation to the Hessian derived from a penalty-formulation of the objective function. Sparseness allows to have the Hessian in memory and compute update directions at very low cost. This results in decent reconstruction of the multiple parameters at very low additional memory and computational expense.},

abstract ={Full waveform inversion of ground-penetrating radar data is an emerging technique for the quantitative, high-resolution imaging of the near subsurface. Here, we present a 2-D frequency-domain full waveform inversion for the simultaneous reconstruction of the dielectric permittivity and of the electrical conductivity. The inverse problem is solved with a quasi-Newton optimization scheme, where the influence of the Hessian is approximated by the L-BFGS-B algorithm. This formulation can be considered to be fully multiparameter since it enables to update permittivity and conductivity values within the same descent step, provided we define scales of measurement through a reference permittivity, a reference conductivity, and an additional scaling factor. Numerical experiments on a benchmark from the literature demonstrate that the inversion is very sensitive to the parameter scaling, despite the consideration of the approximated Hessian that should correct for parameter dimensionalities. A proper scaling should respect the natural sensitivity of the misfit function and give priority to the parameter that has the most impact on the data (the permittivity, in our case). We also investigate the behaviour of the inversion with respect to frequency sampling, considering the selected frequencies either simultaneously or sequentially. As the relative imprint of permittivity and conductivity in the data varies with frequency, the simultaneous reconstruction of both parameters takes a significant benefit from broad frequency bandwidth data, so that simultaneous or cumulative strategies should be favoured. We illustrate our scaling approach with a realistic synthetic example for the imaging of a complex subsurface from on-ground multioffset data. Considering data acquired only from the ground surface increases the ill-posedness of the inverse problem and leads to a strong indetermination of the less-constrained conductivity parameters. A Tikhonov regularization can prevent the creation of high-wavenumber artifacts in the conductivity model that compensate for erroneous low-wavenumber structures, thus enabling to select model solutions. We propose a workflow for multiparameter imaging involving both parameter scaling and regularization. Optimal combinations of scaling factors and regularization weights can be identified by seeking regularization levels that exhibit a clear minimum of final data misfit with respect to parameter scaling. We confirm this workflow by inverting noise-contaminated synthetic data. In a surface-to-surface acquisition configuration, we have been able to reconstruct an accurate permittivity structure and a smooth version of the conductivity distribution, based entirely on the analysis of the data misfit with respect to parameter scaling, for different regularization levels.},

abstract ={Multiparameter full waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging quantitative seismic imaging method for lithological characterization and reservoir monitoring. The difficulties in multiparameter FWI arise from the variable influence of the different parameter classes on the phase and amplitude of the data, and the trade-off between these. In this framework, choosing a suitable parametrization of the subsurface and designing the suitable FWI workflow are two key methodological issues in non-linear waveform inversion. We assess frequency-domain visco-acoustic FWI to reconstruct the compressive velocity (VP), the density (ρ) or the impedance (IP) and the quality factor (QP), from the hydrophone component, using a synthetic data set that is representative of the Valhall oil field in the North Sea. We first assess which of the (VP, ρ) and (VP, IP) parametrizations provides the most reliable FWI results when dealing with wide-aperture data. Contrary to widely accepted ideas, we show that the (VP, ρ) parametrization allows a better reconstruction of both the VP, ρ and IP parameters, first because it favours the broad-band reconstruction of the dominant VP parameter, and secondly because the trade-off effects between velocity and density at short-to-intermediate scattering angles can be removed by multiplication, to build an impedance model. This allows for the matching of the reflection amplitudes, while the broad-band velocity model accurately describes the kinematic attributes of both the diving waves and reflections. Then, we assess different inversion strategies to recover the quality factor QP, in addition to parameters VP and ρ. A difficulty related to attenuation estimation arises because, on the one hand the values of QP are on average one order of magnitude smaller than those of VP and ρ, and on the other hands model perturbations relative to the starting models can be much higher for QP than for VP and ρ during FWI. In this framework, we show that an empirical tuning of the FWI regularization, which is adapted to each parameter class, is a key issue to correctly account for the attenuation in the inversion. We promote a hierarchical approach where the dominant parameter VP is reconstructed first from the full data set (i.e. without any data preconditioning) to build a velocity model as kinematically accurate as possible before performing the joint update of the three parameter classes during a second step. This hierarchical imaging of compressive wave speed, density and attenuation is applied to a real wide-aperture ocean-bottom-cable data set from the Valhall oil field. Several geological features, such as accumulation of gas below barriers of claystone and soft quaternary sediment are interpreted in the FWI models of density and attenuation. The models of VP, ρ and QP that have been developed by visco-acoustic FWI of the hydrophone data can be used as initial models to perform visco-elastic FWI of the geophone data for the joint update of the compressive and shear wave speeds.},

  abstract = {Wave equation based inversions, such as full-waveform
                  inversion and reverse-time migration, are
                  challenging because of their computational costs,
                  memory requirements and reliance on accurate initial
                  models. To confront these issues, we propose a novel
                  formulation of wave equation based inversion based
                  on a penalty method. In this formulation, the
                  objective function consists of a data-misfit term
                  and a penalty term, which measures how accurately
                  the wavefields satisfy the wave equation. This new
                  approach is a major departure from current
                  formulations where forward and adjoint wavefields,
                  which both satisfy the wave equation, are correlated
                  to compute updates for the unknown model
                  parameters. Instead, we carry out the inversions
                  over two alternating steps during which we first
                  estimate the wavefield everywhere, given the current
                  model parameters, source and observed data, followed
                  by a second step during which we update the model
                  parameters, given the estimate for the wavefield
                  everywhere and the source. Because the inversion
                  involves both the synthetic wavefields and the
                  medium parameters, its search space is enlarged so
                  that it suffers less from local minima. Compared to
                  other formulations that extend the search space of
                  wave equation based inversion, our method differs in
                  several aspects, namely (i) it avoids storage and
                  updates of the synthetic wavefields because we
                  calculate these explicitly by finding solutions that
                  obey the wave equation and fit the observed data and
                  (ii) no adjoint wavefields are required to update
                  the model, instead our updates are calculated from
                  these solutions directly, which leads to significant
                  computational savings. We demonstrate the validity
                  of our approach by carefully selected examples and
                  discuss possible extensions and future research.},

                  optimization problems based on a penalty
                  formulation. This method aims to combine advantages
                  of both full-space and reduced methods by exploiting
                  a large search-space (consisting of both control and
                  state variables) while allowing for an efficient
                  implementation that avoids storing and updating the
                  state-variables. This leads to a method that has
                  roughly the same per-iteration complexity as
                  conventional reduced approaches while dening an
                  objective that is less non-linear in the control
                  variable by implicitly relaxing the constraint. We
                  apply the method to a seismic inverse problem where

abstract = {Many structured data-fitting applications require the solution of an optimization problem involving a sum over a potentially large number of measurements. Incremental gradient algorithms offer inexpensive iterations by sampling a subset of the terms in the sum; these methods can make great progress initially, but often slow as they approach a solution. In contrast, full-gradient methods achieve steady convergence at the expense of evaluating the full objective and gradient on each iteration. We explore hybrid methods that exhibit the benefits of both approaches. Rate-of-convergence analysis shows that by controlling the sample size in an incremental-gradient algorithm, it is possible to maintain the steady convergence rates of full-gradient methods. We detail a practical quasi-Newton implementation based on this approach. Numerical experiments illustrate its potential benefits.},

These application are characterized by the need to propagate many wavelengths through an inhomogeneous medium. The typical size of the problems in 3D applications precludes the use of direct factorization to solve the equation and hence iterative methods are used in practice. For higher wavenumbers, the system becomes increasingly indefinite and thus good preconditioners need to be constructed. In this note we consider an accelerated Kazcmarz method (CGMN) and present an expression for the resulting iteration matrix. This iteration matrix can be used to analyze the convergence of the CGMN method. In particular, we present a Fourier analysis for the method applied to the 1D Helmholtz equation. This analysis suggests an optimal choice of the relaxation parameter. Finally, we present some numerical experiments.},

abstract = {Many inverse problems include nuisance parameters which, while not of direct interest, are required to recover primary parameters. Structure present in these problems allows efficient optimization strategies - a well known example is variable projection, where nonlinear least squares problems which are linear in some parameters can be very efficiently optimized. In this paper, we extend the idea of projecting out a subset over the variables to a broad class of maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori likelihood (MAP) problems with nuisance parameters, such as variance or degrees of freedom. As a result, we are able to incorporate nuisance parameter estimation into large-scale constrained and unconstrained inverse problem formulations. We apply the approach to a variety of problems, including estimation of unknown variance parameters in the Gaussian model, degree of freedom (d.o.f.) parameter estimation in the context of robust inverse problems, automatic calibration, and optimal experimental design. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate improvement in recovery of primary parameters for several large- scale inverse problems. The proposed approach is compatible with a wide variety of algorithms and formulations, and its implementation requires only minor modifications to existing algorithms.},
